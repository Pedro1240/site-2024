                              Hi, I'm Pedro, a 17-year-old IT student with a passion for web design. Throughout my school years, I've tackled various projects, from basic websites to personal blogs.
                              I'm driven by a commitment to excellence, ensuring that each project is both functional and visually appealing.
                              I thrive on challenges and stay updated with the latest design trends. I'm not just a student; I'm a passionate creator, eager to make a meaningful impact through my work in the dynamic field of web design.</p>

                              I specialize in web designing with proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a solid grasp of Python and database management.
                              Despite my lack of professional work experience, I have successfully completed projects encompassing basic websites and personal blogs during my school years.
                              My focus on hands-on experience has allowed me to develop practical skills in coding and design, preparing me for future opportunities in the field.
                              I am eager to leverage my knowledge and enthusiasm to contribute to exciting projects and further enhance my capabilities.

                            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                            <p>I really like football, both playing it with my friends and watching matches. Going out and exploring new places is something I enjoy too. Watching movies is a cool way for me to unwind and escape into different stories.
    
                            When I'm indoors, I love playing video games. But what's even cooler is trying my hand at creating my own games. It's like bringing my ideas to life in a virtual world.
                            
                            These hobbies make my life interesting and colorful. They're not just fun; they also help me learn and grow in different ways.</p>
